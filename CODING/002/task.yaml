  There is a server log file at CODING/002/data/server.log in the workspace.
  Each line has the format:

    [LEVEL] YYYY-MM-DD HH:MM:SS message text

  Where LEVEL is one of: INFO, WARN, ERROR

  Your task:
  1. Read CODING/002/data/server.log
  2. Count the number of lines for each log level (INFO, WARN, ERROR)
  3. Write the counts to results/log_summary.txt in this exact format:

    INFO: <count>
    WARN: <count>
    ERROR: <count>

  The counts must be in that order. Do not include any other lines.
