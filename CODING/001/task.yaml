title: "Fix a broken temperature converter"
category: coding
difficulty: easy
prompt: |
  There is a Python script at data/temperature.py that is supposed
  to convert a list of Celsius temperatures to Fahrenheit and write the results
  to a file, but it contains bugs that produce wrong output.

  The conversion formula is: F = (C × 9/5) + 32

  Input temperatures (Celsius): 0, 100, -40, 37, 22

  Expected output in results/temperatures.txt (one value per line, rounded to
  1 decimal place):
    32.0
    212.0
    -40.0
    98.6
    71.6

  Your task:
  1. Read data/temperature.py and identify all bugs
  2. Fix the script so it produces the correct output
  3. Run the fixed script to generate results/temperatures.txt
