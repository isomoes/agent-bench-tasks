  Use system tools to find the operating system version and save the result.

  Your task:
  1. Use appropriate system commands to detect the OS version
  2. Write the OS version to a file: results/os_version.txt

  The file should contain just the OS version string, for example:
    - Linux: "Linux 6.17.8-arch1-1"
    - macOS: "macOS 14.1.1"
    - Windows: "Windows 11 22H2"

  Use tools like uname, lsb_release, /etc/os-release, or platform-specific commands.
