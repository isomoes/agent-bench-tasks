title: "Find all Python files and report their sizes"
category: tools
difficulty: easy
prompt: |
  The workspace contains a directory tree with various files. Your task is to
  find every Python file (.py extension) anywhere in the workspace and report
  each file's path and size.

  Your task:
  1. Search the entire workspace recursively for files ending in .py
  2. For each file found, record its path (relative to the workspace root)
     and its size in bytes
  3. Sort the results by file path alphabetically
  4. Write the results to results/py_files.txt, one file per line in this
     exact format:

     <relative-path>: <size> bytes

  Example:
     scripts/hello.py: 142 bytes
     utils/helper.py: 87 bytes

  Do not include directories, only files.
